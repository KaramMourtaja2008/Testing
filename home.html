            <h3>While the terms equity and equality may sound similar, the implementation of one
                versus the other can lead to dramatically different outcomes for marginalized
                people.Equality means each individual or group of people is given the same resources or
                opportunities. Equity recognizes that each person has different circumstances and
                allocates the exact resources and opportunities needed to reach an equal outcome. </h3>

            <h3>In the illustration above, two individuals have unequal access to a system â€” in this
                case, the tree that provides fruit. With equal support from evenly distributed tools,
                their access to the fruit still remains unequal. The equitable solution, however,
                allocates the exact resources that each person needs to access the fruit, leading to
                positive outcomes for both individuals.</h3>
